# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This AWS Teraform module sets up a CodeBuild/CodePipeline project that deploys a Terraform project from GitHub.

  Just configure the variables with the github settings and an OAuth token giving it permissions to access the code.
  You can also configure the required permissions that the CodeBuild/Pipeline roles require as you wish.

  The `buildspec.yml` file in the source project can be used to match environment variables you set in this project (see Usage).

  Current issues:
   * You need to change an environment variable to `terraform destroy...` a project
   * You must remember to `terraform destroy...` a project before destroying this project.
   * The examples shown are setup with projects running terraform using `var_file`s. Things could be adjusted to run terraform in any way you wish.
   * [BUG] Currently, obtaining the GitHub token from SSM flags up as a change on every TF run.

# Pre-requisites
requirements: |-
   * Terraform 0.12.x (Although this project is written in Terraform 0.12, the pipeline it deploys can be used to deploy using ANY version of Terraform)
   * A [github Oauth token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens) stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store
   * A terraform project with an AWS CodeBuild `buildspec.yml` file in the root directory checked into GitHub

  Also see [this example project](https://github.com/vishbhalla/terraform-aws-codebuild-deploy-tf-example)
  It is setup to deploy [this example hello world Lambda Terraform project](https://github.com/vishbhalla/terraform-aws-hello-world-lambda)
  Taking particular note of [buildspec.yml](https://github.com/vishbhalla/terraform-aws-hello-world-lambda/blob/master/buildspec.yml) file
  and how it ties in with the environment variables set here in `var.codebuild_env_vars`.

  To trigger a build, check in some code into the branch `var.git_branch` or manually click the `Release Change` button on the AWS CodePipeline pipeline page.
